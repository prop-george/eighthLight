Tic Tac Toe Swift project


I chose to write this application using Appple's new "swift" language, since I had not used it before and am very interested in learning it. This seemed like a great opportunity to do so!

The requirements for the challenge: 

Coding challenge
Create an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game. Your game should allow a human to play against an unbeatable computer player. The computer player must never lose and should win when possible.


After reading the requirements, I did a little research on AI algorithms for tic-tac-toe. I found this one on stack overflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/11476076/1337273
which looked like it met all the requirements with a relatively straight-forward approach.

Based on the above algorithm, it was pretty easy to simply write the functions and piece it all together!
